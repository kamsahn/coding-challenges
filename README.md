# Welcome to Sam Learns

A place where I post recent "learnings" whether they be coding challenges, my thoughts on a new (to me)
technology, etc. 

Having taken the bootcamp route to software engineering, I've been missing some fundamental knowledge
that didn't seem to crop up in my every day life as a Fullstack Engineer at [Perceptive Automata](https://www.perceptiveautomata.com/).
I'd like to try to fill some of my own knowledge gaps so I decided to keep record of some of the things
I've learned (am learning). Hopefully this is also a good way for other folks to keep tabs on what I'm
learning about, too. Thanks for stopping by to see my *slightest* attempt at a blog ;)
